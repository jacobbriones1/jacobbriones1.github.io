# Introduction
2020 has been one of the most stressful years of my life, and I (like many others I assume) wouldn't have been able to make it through without alcohol.
Alcohol consumption has increased signifiantly as a result of the stay at home orders, and public distress. 
But why is this? Am I a horrible person for downing an entire bottle of cheap gas-station merlot after work? 
Perhaps.. But despite what most religious organizations would have you believe, the desire to drinking alcohol is encoded in our DNA.
In fact, our interest in alcohol dates back over 6,000 years. But how did alcohol become part of our biological history? 
The answer to this question can be understood by understanding *yeast*, one of the first organisms that humans domesticated. 
In particular, we will take a look at a certain species of yeast called *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*, which is capable of brewing wine.

# The Diauxic Shift
The yeast *S. cerevisiae* often live on grapevines. It converts **glucose** found in fruit into **ethanol**.
In hopes of understanding let us ask the following question:

  *Why do crushed grapes need to be stored in tightly sealed barrels in order to produce alcohol?*
