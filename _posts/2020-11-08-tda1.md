## Introduction
Topological Data Science(TDA) has been bursting with new applications in machine learning and data science this year. 
The central dogma of TDA is that data (even complex, and high dimensional) has an underlying shape, and understanding this shape helps to reveal
the process used to generate it. For a great survey on TDA for data scientists, check out [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.04019).
One of the ways which TDA helps understand this shape is through **persistence homology**, which will be explained in this article.
I will be using giotto-tda for calculations and examples. 
The software is free, and instructions for downloading it are aviailable on the [giotto-tda Github page](https://github.com/giotto-ai/giotto-tda)
along with several Jupyter notebooks highlighting some of the giotto-tda features.<br>

## Persistent Homology
The goal of persistent homology is to determine the *true* topological descriptors of a dataset.
As an intuitive motivation, suppose $$X$$ a is a set of randomly generated points in two-dimensions, such as the one below. <br>

Although real world data is much more complicated than this, it is helpful to understand how TDA applies to datasets which we already
understand. We know that the data shown above, for example, is a single connected component with a single hole in the middle.
Hence, we should be able to confirm this using persistent homology. But first, we need a few preliminary concepts from Algebraic Topology.

### Simplicial Complexes
Simplicial complexes are the main object of study in TDA. They are a topological space which can be thought of as higher dimensional graphs. They are composed by "*gluing together*" multiple **simplices**. <br>
- A $$k$$**-simplex** $$\sigma$$ is a generalization of a triangle in $$k$$ dimensions. 

More speficically, given a set $$X=\{x_1,\dots,x_d\}$$ of affinely independent points in $$\mathbb{R}^d$$, a $$k$$-dimensional simplex $$\sigma=[x_1,\dots,x_k]$$ is the convex hull of $$X$$.

|:--:| | 
*(a) 0-simplex is a vertex, (b) 1-simplex is a line, (c) 2-simplex is a triangle, (d) 3-simplex is a tetrahedron* |

Simplicies make up simplicial complexes, that is, in a *very* informal way, we can say that

- A **simplicial complex** is a set of simplices which are "glued together".<br>

I am avoiding mathematical rigor here by saying "glued together", but I think it is more useful to understand what the general *vibe* is first.
The picture below is an example of a simplicial complex with 18 $$0$$-simplexes, 23 $$1$$-simplexes, 8 $$2$$-simplexes, and a single $$3$$-simplex
<p align="center">

</p>
Notice the way that simplices are glued together. They must be glued in a certain way. 
To show what I mean by this without getting too technical, consider the non-example shown below.
<p align="center">
  <img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/Simplicial_complex_nonexample.png" height = "309" width = "205" alt>
</p>

The motivation for defining simplicial complexes is that we can think of each one of our data points as a simplex, and thus by
creating a simplicial complex from these simplices, we are able to extract meaningful topological descriptors which can reveal
the *shape* of our dataset. <br>
But *how do know which points in our data represent which simplexes?* And
*how do we actually obtain a simplicial complex?*

It's **crucial** to keep these questions in mind as we go along, so that we don't get lost in the abstractions, and to make use of the definitons.

### The Čech Complex
Given a dataset $$X$$ (a *point cloud*), we want to create a simplicial complex. 
To do this, the idea is to place a [closed ball](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ClosedBall.html) $$\bar{B}_\epsilon(X)$$ of radius $$\epsilon$$ around each point, and create an edge between any two points if their closed $$\epsilon$$ balls intersect. <br>
<!---Cech Complex Definition -->
- Fix $$\epsilon>0$$, and assume $$X=\{x_1,\dots,x_d\}$$. The **Čech Complex** $$Č_\epsilon(X)$$ is a simplicial complex whose simplicies are defined as follows:
  - For each subset of $$S\subseteq X$$, form a closed $$\frac{\epsilon}{2}$$ ball around each point. If each closed ball has a nonempty intersection, then
include $$S$$ as a simplex. (See the image below)

<p align="center">
  <img src = "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sayan_Mukherjee7/publication/244990224/figure/fig2/AS:431569287553027@1479905544310/depicts-a-simple-example-of-a-Cech-complex-in-R-2-An-important-result.png" height = "235" width = "450" alt>
</p>
Above we see the simplicial complex has 1 connected component, and 1 hole. 
But what if we change the value of $$\epsilon$$? For example, if $$\epsilon$$ is equal to the largest distance between any two points,
then we obtain a single simplex.
<br>

The natural question to ask at this point, is *what is the best choice for the value of* $$\epsilon$$? 
But we are not interested in answering this. Rather, we analyze the topological features which *persist* as we let $$\epsilon$$ vary (hence, the name *persistence homology*).
The features which persist as $$\epsilon$$ varies greatly are considered to be the "true" features.
