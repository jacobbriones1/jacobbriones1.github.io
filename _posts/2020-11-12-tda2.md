# Introduction
Persistent homology is a method for computing topological features of a space at different spatial resolutions. The main way we do this is by plotting persistence diagrams. Specifically, we record the duration of the presence of each betti number, where the $$n$$-th Betti number $$\beta_n$$ to be the dimension of the $$n$$-th homology group. $$\beta_0$$ is the number of connected components, $$\beta_1$$ is the number of holes, $$\beta_2$$ the number of voids, etc.
