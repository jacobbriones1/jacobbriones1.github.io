# What is a Tensor?
In order to understand what a tensor is, it is helpful to understand what a *vector* is. A vector is a mathematical object which has both magnitude and direction. The magnitude of a vector is a scalar quantity which describes the vector's length. To define the *direction* of a vector, we must specify a *basis*. In the plane, the vectors $\vec{e}_1$ and $\vec{e}_2$
