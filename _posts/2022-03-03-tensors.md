# What is a Tensor?
In order to understand what a tensor is, it is helpful to understand what a *vector* is. A vector is a mathematical object which has both magnitude and direction. The magnitude of a vector is a scalar quantity which describes the vector's length. To define the *direction* of a vector, we must specify a *basis*. For example a basis for $$\mathbb{R}^2$$ (the plane in two dimensions), is given by the unit vectors $$\vec{e}_1$$ and $$\vec{e}_2$$, where

$$
\vec{e}_1 = 
\begin{pmatrix}
1\\
0
\end{pmatrix}
\text{ and }
\vec{e}_2 = 
\begin{pmatrix}
0\\ 
1
\end{pmatrix}
$$

These two vectors define (in the plane) the horizontal ($$\vec{e}_1$$) and vertical direction ($$\vec{e}_2$$). So every point on the plane is a combination of these two vectors. For example, 

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
-4\\ 
7
\end{pmatrix}
= 
\begin{pmatrix}
-4\\ 
0
\end{pmatrix}
+
\begin{pmatrix}
0\\ 
7
\end{pmatrix}
= 
-4 \begin{pmatrix}
1\\ 
0
\end{pmatrix}
+
7\begin{pmatrix}
0\\ 
1
\end{pmatrix}
$$
