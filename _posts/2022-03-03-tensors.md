# What is a Tensor?
In order to understand what a tensor is, it is helpful to understand what a *vector* is. A vector is a mathematical object which has both magnitude and direction. The magnitude of a vector is a scalar quantity which describes the vector's length. To define the *direction* of a vector, we must specify a *basis*. For example a basis for $\mathbb{R}^2$ (a plane), is given by the unit vectors $\vec{e}_1$ and $\vec{e}_2$, where
$$
\vec{e}_1 =
\left(\begin{array}{cc} 
1 \\
0
\end{array}\right)
\text{ and }
\vec{e}_2=
\left(\begin{array}{cc} 
0 \\
1
\end{array}\right)
$$
